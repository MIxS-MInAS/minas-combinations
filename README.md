# minas-combinations

Schemas of most common ancient DNA + sample type MIxS combination.

This repository holds _partial_ LinkML schemas of the relevant classes and slots for defining ancient DNA specific _combinations_.

The purpose of these partial schemas is they can be 'merged' into draft full schemas to extend it, using e.g. `yq`.

See the [minas](https://github.com/MIxS-MInAS/minas) repository for such extended draft 'full' MIxS schemas including the combinations and new MInAS proposed extensions.
